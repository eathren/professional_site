### Gatsby Technical Blog

This is a blog detailing some of my thoughts on technology and software, as well as some techinical / "how-to" posts about overcomining some of the very specific challenges I've had to face as a software engineer. It also is a place where I outline some of my pet projects as well, and perhaps some examples of my actual professional work in the future (employer permission pending). 

Software can be a tricky field, and I've lost track of all the little gotcha's it contains after more than 5,000 hours working professionally in it, plus the time I've spent recently getting my Masters in CS, so I think it's really just good karma to leave a resource that others can tap if they've hit the same weird bugs that I have in the past. (Looking at you, Gatsby and Raygun.)

Utilizies Gatsby's graphql data layer for static markdown -> webpage page setup, react components, sass, as well as @reach/router. Mobile responsive, the whole she-bang. 

## How to run it

Run <code>Yarn</code> to install the node module packages. <code>Npm i</code> can be used, but yarn plays a little nicer with Gatsby. 

start the dev site with <code>Yarn start</code>. 

If you have issues on windows, a recent gatsby bug (or intentional design?) seems to pop up that prevents the site from building on windows. Download the netlify cli and run it with that instead.
