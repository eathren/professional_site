This is a blog detailing some of my thoughts on technology and software, as well as some techinical / "how-to" posts about overcomining some of the very specific challenges I've had to face as a software engineer. 

Utilizies Gatsby's graphql data layer for static markdown -> webpage page setup, react components, sass, as well as @reach/router. Mobile responsive, the whole she-bang. 

## How to run it

run <code> Yarn </code> to install the node module packages. Npm i can be used, but yarn plays a little nicer with Gatsby. 

start the dev site with <code> Yarn start </code>. 

If you have issues on windows, a recent gatsby bug (or intentional design?) seems to pop up that prevents the site from building on windows. Download the netlify cli and run it with that instead.
