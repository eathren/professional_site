I like to browse the new programmer subreddits and communities, notably ones like r/learnjavascript, r/learnprogramming, some discord channels for rust (although I'm the student there most often), and the like. I've found that I've given the same advice almost verbatim to new programmers who are frustrated that they've spent three to six months (usually, but sometimes up to a year) learning and following tutorials, and they just _aren't_ making progress. They'll follow a tutorial, have the git repo, push it online, and then thirty minutes later they'll realize they don't remember how they did any of it! If they weren't copy-pasting the final source code, than they were following along so closely that they were essentially copy pasting anyways.

And don't get me wrong. Doing this at the start **is not a bad thing**. Programming is _hard_. Learning to program is just bloody difficult, because there are all these tools, and new people learning just don't know about them. And the only way to really learn about them is to put a hundred holes in the wall as you fight your way to competency.

#### In any case, without further ado, my general guide to how to get out of tutorial hell.

_Stop trying to memorize. Think of something you want to build, and start building it._

_The beginning of programming is super frustrating because there are all these tools that you simply don't know about, and while you try to learn, you're just slamming your head into the wall endlessly. The easiest way to find the tools is to build stuff._

_Think of what it is you want to build, and break it down. You want to build a mini site that checks the weather for only your town? Great. What are the problems stopping you? You'll need to find a free, instant source of data (Google, free weather apis), then pick one and read the docs. Once you have the endpoints and account, say, "how do I get that data, from there to here?". Google that too. Find javascript fetch, or axios, or w/e. Google "how to fetch data from api". Go through those examples, and build a working fetch. Now the problem is, " how do I display this data?". Google that.... starting to see the picture?_

_So very little of programming is memorization. I've found that after two years of working for a startup doing JS stuff, that things stick after five or ten times, but even on time 30 I'm still looking up exactly how to structure pieces, or different built-in functions etc. Very, very rarely have I had a new problem handed to me and I thought," eureka! I know EXACTLY how to build this down the the last character thanks to memorization!" Nah._

_Find a thing. Break it down. Build and research and you go. Escape from tutorial hell! Stop watching new videos and copy-pasting mindlessly, then looking at the final product and saying, "Well, I I this didn't I? Why don't I remember it?"_

Agree? Disagree? You can send me a message below, I'd love to talk to you about it. If you have any other questions or how to take the step past beginner and you're struggling, I'd love to talk with you as well. I've been there, and without the great resources and people I've met along the way, it would have been much, much harder to have gotten where I am today.
